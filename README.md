# CFG-Intro-to-Python
I made this short code as a final project for the Code First Girls Intro to Python course in 2022. 
It uses the Edamam API and helps users decide what to eat given their dietary requirements. Enjoy!

The workflow of the code is below:

1. we'll create a user profile that mentions which dietary requirements they have
2. we will make some lists that keep track of the recipies/ingredients/uri's we are going through
3. and we'll compute the caloric and sugar intake for each recipe we find
4. we will display the recipies with the lowest caloric and sugar intake
5. afterwards, we can ask the code to tell us a random recipe to use
6. and it can also open the uri for us (if we want to)
7. when the code finished running, you'll see the recipies saved up in a txt file
